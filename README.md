# Countries Explorer

Just a simple app I made to explore countries around the world. It pulls data from the REST Countries API and shows you info about different countries.

## What it does

You can browse through countries and see their flags. Click on any country to get more details like population, capital, languages they speak, etc. There's also a search if you're looking for something specific.

Works on mobile too.

## Built with

- React + TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- REST Countries API

## Running locally

You'll need Node.js installed.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173

To build:
```bash
npm run build
```
